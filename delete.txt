a=amount
p=initial principal or loan amount
r=rate of interest per annum

formula for monthly payment is:
A=p(r(1+r)^n)/((1+r)^n -1)

for example:
p=10000;
r=7.5%/12(THIS IS PER MONTH INTEREST rate)
n=no. of years=5years=(5*12) no. of months


then,after applying above formula.......A=200.38;

loan payement=loan balance *(annual interest rate /12)
